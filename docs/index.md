## Overview

Cartis2D is a desktop level editor for 2D games that makes map creation simple and predictable. It focuses on the essentials—tiles, objects, and layout—without unnecessary complexity.

The editor is **free to use** and distributed as a pre-built application. While the editor is closed source, the **Python interface for Pygame integration is fully open source**.

## Philosophy

> **Do less, but do it well**

Many level editors are powerful but heavy—creating friction instead of helping. Cartis2D prioritizes speed, clarity, and practical workflows over feature bloat.

- Rapid iteration without unnecessary complexity
- Flexible placement—not everything locked to a grid
- Focus on gameplay, not fighting your tools
- Predictable behavior over hidden magic

---

## Features

### Tile System
- **Auto-tiling** for corners, edges, and centers
- **Randomized placement** from tile sets for natural variation
- Fast, intuitive tile-based editing

### Object System
**Objects** are first-class elements defined by **position and size**, perfect for:
- Enemy spawns & player start positions
- Triggers, zones, and boundaries
- 2D physics rectangles
- Any dynamic game entity

Objects can be freely placed or snapped to grid when precision is needed.

### Editor
- Lightweight UI for fast iteration
- Optional snap-to-grid for precise alignment
- Designed for focused, productive workflows

---

## Python Integration

Maps load into Pygame projects via an **open source Python interface**:

- Clean, documented API
- Easy to integrate and extend
- Transparent implementation
